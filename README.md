# Site for the Blue Vision Initiative

3,800,000 Litres Saved Annually | 15000+ Individuals Directly Impacted

Started in the summer of 2018, the Blue Vision Initiative is a project aimed to tackle the rising problem of depleting water resources by optimizing everyday consumption. We plan to achieve this by enabling the use of water saving aerators and spreading awareness among the youth, ultimately creating individual changemakers.

I worked as the CTO of this project and was responsible for developing the front and backend of the website along with some analysis tools we used to measure the amount of water that was being saved.
